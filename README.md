If you are planning to host your blog or create a website, Wordpress is the solution of choice. It is the #1 CMS, with a very active community around it. Whatever features you want to add, you will certainly find the plugin you need.

WordPress is a bit slow at startup. This is dommageable for your usersâ€™ experience and SEO. Caching with Redis will help in that matter.
There are many ways to install WordPress. The one we speak about is primarily for those who know what Docker containers are and can use Linux trough SSH. If this is not your case, it might be simpler to go through a host that offers WordPress pre-installed.

If Docker or Docker Compose is not installed, it is relatively simple. Just follow the instructions in the documentation for Docker, then follow the instructions for Docker Compose.
